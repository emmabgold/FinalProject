    <p class="lead">

    <p>We are both MPhils from the U.S., and we've quickly fallen in love with all Cambridge has to offer. We're here to show you the very best coffeeshops, restaurants, pubs, and more. Whether you want to make the most of a day here or waste an afternoon with a pint, we're happy to be your local guides.</p>
